The app has two parts. When you first open the app there are buttons on the top. With these buttons you can either create a circle, square, or triangle. Then you can click a button to show/hide the coordinates of the shape as you drag it around, resize the shape to a random size, or change the color to a random color. 

The second part of the app is the game Hangman. There is a button for every different letter. Click on one to guess a letter. If correct, it will update the word with the guessed letter, but if wrong it will draw another part of the man. If you get too many guesses wrong then you lose.
